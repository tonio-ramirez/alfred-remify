DailyWTF Remify Alfred Workflow
-------------------------------

If you frequent the DailyWTF site (http://www.thedailywtf.com), you've probably come across posts
by Remy Porter, who usually (always?) includes HTML comments in his articles,
and adds code so that when you click on a certain word, something magical
happens.

This Alfred workflow, when run, shows those comments and highlights the
clickable word.

I take no credit for the JavaScript code that does this, although I did tweak
it a little bit.

Currently only works with Google Chrome.
